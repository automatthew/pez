Nearly all of the work, especially design work, was done by John Walker,
and we're indebted for his release of the code to the public domain.
This library was originally called Atlast, and a pristine version can be
downloaded from Mr. Walker's site at http://fourmilab.ch/ .  (It was
renamed to Pez when I discovered that I was not the only one to have the
obvious idea of adapting public domain code for my own purposes.)

Porting to x86-64, adding FFI, adding OS-level facilities, and general
mangling was done by Pete Elmore, the current developer/maintainer of
Pez.  (All of which has been done with an eye to using it as a VM for
his yet-to-be-released language.)

The awesome name Pez (so appropriate for a stack-based language) was the
idea of Matthew King.  Matthew has also helped with bug fixes and OS X
compatibility issues.

Jeff Hodges was invaluable in helping to get autotools working properly.
