Nearly all of the work, especially design work, was done by John Walker,
and we're indebted for his release of the code to the public domain.
This library was originally called Atlast, and a pristine version can be
downloaded from Mr. Walker's site at http://fourmilab.ch/ .  (It was
renamed to Pez when I discovered that I was not the only one to have the
obvious idea of adapting public domain code for my own purposes.)

The current state of the codebase (the bugs fixed, the features added
or removed, the refactoring, etc.) is due to the efforts of Pete Elmore
and Matthew King.

Jeff Hodges was invaluable in helping to get autotools working properly.
