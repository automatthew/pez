These are the things that remain to be done to make Atlast a workable VM
for Roboto.

* Misc cleanup
	* Make my own idioms conform a little more to the Atlast codebase, where
	  it makes sense.
	* Fix up some of Atlast's quirks, where it makes sense.  (e.g., change
	  'Push = x' to 'Push(x)'.)

* Enable multiple instances within a single process.

* Serialization of the dictionary/code/etc.
	* I expect text to be easier than binary images.
	* Also, do both if possible.

* Add a C ffi
	* (More) support for dlload et al
	* Some nice wrapping for same
	* The hard part:  calling the functions!
* Maybe get rid of the case-insensitivity and turn everything lower-case;
  depends on how much of a pain that turns out to be.
