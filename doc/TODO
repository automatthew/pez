These are the things that remain to be done to make Atlast a workable VM
for Roboto.

* Make it buildable as a .so.

* Misc cleanup
	* Make my own idioms conform a little more to the Atlast codebase.

* Enable multiple instances within a single process.

* Serialization of the dictionary/code/etc.
	* I expect text to be easier than binary images.
	* Also, do both if possible.

* Add a C ffi
	* Add support for dlload et al
	* Some nice wrapping for same
