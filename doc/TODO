This is a sort of unordered roadmap for Pez.

* Support running as script (#!/usr/bin/env pez)

* Enable multiple instances within a single process.  This is both nice to have
  and necessary for the concurrency model I want to implement.  It's going to be
  kind of tedious, though, as it will require moving all of the static variables
  into a struct (representing the interpreter; each with its own stack, return
  stack, input stream, heap, etc.), then changing all of the primitives to take
  a pointer to the interpreter as an argument.  So I'm sort of lazily putting it
  off for now.

* Serialization of the dictionary/code/etc.
	* I expect text to be easier than binary images.
	* Also, do both if possible.

* Add examples for the FFI, and write a couple of libraries.

* A make install task, and a Pkgfile for CRUX at least.

* Set up something like $LIBDIR/pez, to make it a little more easy to distribute
  a standard library (both FFI .so files and regular .pez files) with Pez and
  load files from it.

* Maybe get rid of the case-insensitivity and turn everything lower-case;
  depends on how much of a pain that turns out to be.

* Misc cleanup
	* Make my own idioms conform a little more to the Atlast codebase, where
	  it makes sense.
	* Fix up some of Atlast's quirks, where it makes sense.  (e.g., change
	  'Push = x' to 'Push(x)'.)

* Investigate a few key optimizations, as I'm planning on using Pez as an
  intermediate language for Roboto.
